This application is meant to allow a developer participate in the development of an open source project that 
  aims to allow anyone on earth with an old android phone to run locally any miniature LLM, and give the application relevant permissions so
  the user maintains control over their privacy, at all times.

The interface should be simple, and allow the user to show a selection of LLMs available to download, select which one he wants to run,
  download and run it. It will as for permissions for the calendar, phone call history and SMS to start with. The LLM will be able to respond in a 
  contextual manner, and suggest tasks to be performed using application API integrated with our phollama application.
